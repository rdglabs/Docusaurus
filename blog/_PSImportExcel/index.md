# Powershell ImportExcel
If you are have worked with data in powershell you have most likely used the command `export-csv`. This is a great built in command to get the data out of the console and in a file to work with and is easily sharable. I use `export-csv` a lot when I am running large data pull on AD, building computer reports or just need to viw ad sort some data quickly.

I would `export-csv` in a lot of my script and send those csv file out as reports. One day a coworker made a joke about making the report "fancier" since it had made its way up to VIP level. I know about the model `importexcel` but never bothered to work with it, as `export-csv` was good enough.
